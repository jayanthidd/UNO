This ist the documentation for the Uno-Project of GROUP 3, consisting of Iro, Emina, Jayanthi and Elisabeth.

Goal of this program is to be able to play UNO (with the common rules of UNO, as described here: https://www.uno-kartenspiel.de/spielregeln/) with up to 4 real players on one computer. If there are less than 4 human players, the other playes will be substituted by bots.
